Css / bootstrap **

	- responsive / mobile css *

	- chatgroups sidebar scrollable **

Testing / bug fixes **

	- stale date **

	- cross messaging between users (messages to wrong users) - I'm not sure this happens *

	- signup button - disable by default and if invalid -> initialize isValid to false, set isValid to false if username invalid

	- Console errors

		- strict mode error - triggered when a modal is opened

		- unused variables

	- sockets seem to shared between users. Login with different windows / users at the same time and the data gets intermingled ****

Animate message and group loading *

Trim and toLowerCase (except pswd) all user input

Login page - clear err on modal close

Update server returns to use proper header, response codes ? - research proper socket standards

Search should return both users and as well as chatGroups that the user is a part of

Add message box submit button -> useful for mobile
